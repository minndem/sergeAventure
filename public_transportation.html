							The D Sixth Avenue Express is a rapid transit service in the B Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or "bullet", is colored orange since it uses the IND Sixth Avenue Line in Manhattan. I take the train often to get arrount city specially to school. The D train help me it terms of time; it fast and easy for me since the D-train station is not far from the place where I live.

						Generally I don't usually take the bus  that much compare to the train. The reason is that, the bus generally is very slow and if it happens that I have to take the bus, it is probably because I have pleinty of time ahead or I can't get to my destianation with the train.
